# Mirador-y

This is a fork of IIIF's [Mirador](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador), created as a bridge between Mirador and [Yale-Mirador](https://github.com/yale-web-technologies/yale-mirador), a project at Yale University that embeds Mirador (or rather, Mirador-y) in it.

Mirador-y will closely follow the latest development of Mirador and the difference will be kept minimal, only covering features that are not (yet) supported by Mirador that are required by Yale-Mirador.
