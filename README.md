# Mirador-y

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a fork of IIIF's [Mirador](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador), created as a bridge between Mirador and [Yale-Mirador](https://github.com/yale-web-technologies/yale-mirador), a project at Yale University that embeds Mirador (or rather, Mirador-y) in it.

**Mirador is a multi-repository, configurable, extensible, and easy-to-integrate viewer and annotation creation and comparison environment for IIIF resources, ranging from deep-zooming artwork, to complex manuscript objects. It provides a tiling windowed environment for comparing multiple image-based resources, synchronised structural and visual navigation of content using openSeadragon, Open Annotation compliant annotation creation and viewing on deep-zoomable canvases, metadata display, bookreading, and bookmarking.**

Mirador-y will closely follow the latest development of Mirador and the difference will be kept minimal, only covering features that are not (yet) supported by Mirador that are required by Yale-Mirador.
